## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of collecting, clarifying, organizing, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. It transforms high-level ideas and stakeholder requests into a clear set of documented, testable, and prioritized requirements that guide design, development, and testing.

### Why it matters
Requirement analysis is critical because it establishes *what* the system must do and *why*. Good requirement analysis reduces wasted effort, prevents misunderstandings, and ensures the delivered product aligns with user needs and business goals. When done poorly (or skipped), projects commonly suffer from scope creep, missed expectations, repeated rework, delayed timelines, and inflated costs.

### Role in the SDLC
Requirement analysis sits near the start of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and feeds all subsequent phases:

1. **Planning / Initiation** — identifies stakeholders and basic goals.  
2. **Requirement Analysis** — collects detailed functional and non-functional requirements.  
3. **Design** — architects and designers create solutions that meet the documented requirements.  
4. **Implementation** — developers build features according to the design and requirements.  
5. **Testing** — testers verify the implementation satisfies the documented requirements.  
6. **Deployment & Maintenance** — delivered software is monitored and evolved; requirements inform future iterations.

### Types of requirements
- **Functional Requirements**: Specific behaviors or functions the system must provide (e.g., “Users can search properties by location and date”).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**: Quality attributes such as performance, security, accessibility, usability, and scalability (e.g., “Search results must load within 2 seconds”).  
- **Constraints & Assumptions**: Limitations or fixed conditions (e.g., supported browsers, third-party APIs, budget, or regulatory rules).  
- **Business Requirements**: High-level objectives the business needs the system to achieve (e.g., increase bookings by 20% in 6 months).

### Common activities in requirement analysis
- **Stakeholder identification & interviews** — find who will use the system and who has decision power.  
- **Workshops & brainstorming** — gather varied perspectives and align on goals.  
- **User stories / use cases** — describe desired functionality from the user’s perspective.  
- **Wireframes & low-fidelity prototypes** — visualize flows early to validate understanding.  
- **Prioritization** — decide which requirements are must-have vs. nice-to-have.  
- **Validation & sign-off** — stakeholders confirm the documented requirements are correct.

### Key deliverables
- **Requirements document / PRD** (Product Requirements Document)  
- **User stories and acceptance criteria** (for Agile teams)  
- **Wireframes / mockups** (to clarify UI expectations)  
- **Data models / API contracts** (if applicable)  
- **Traceability matrix** (maps requirements to tests and implementation)

### Who should be involved
- **Product Owner / Sponsor** — defines business goals and priorities.  
- **Business Analysts / Requirement Engineers** — lead the analysis and documentation effort.  
- **Designers (UX/UI)** — translate requirements into usable interfaces.  
- **Developers** — validate technical feasibility and provide estimates.  
- **QA/Testers** — ensure requirements are testable and define acceptance tests.  
- **Stakeholders / End users** — provide domain knowledge and validate needs.

### Risks of poor requirement analysis
- Misaligned expectations and features that don’t solve user problems.  
- Costly rework and schedule overruns.  
- Increased technical debt and brittle designs.  
- Low user adoption and negative business impact.

### Practical tip
Treat requirement analysis as an iterative, collaborative process — especially in Agile environments. Start with a minimal validated slice (MVP), deliver quickly, gather user feedback, and evolve requirements. That approach reduces risk and increases the chance of delivering real value.

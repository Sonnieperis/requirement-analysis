# requirement-analysis# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the **Requirement Analysis** phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Explain the importance of gathering and analyzing user and system requirements.
- Document methods and techniques used during requirement analysis.
- Provide examples of how clear requirements lead to effective system design and implementation.

Requirement analysis is a foundational stage in software engineering â€” it helps bridge the gap between what clients *want* and what developers *build*, ensuring the final product aligns with user needs and business objectives.
